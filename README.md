Multiple Disease Prediction System

A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases based on user-input health data. This project leverages machine learning to provide early-stage predictions for educational and demonstrative purposes.

About The Project
The goal of this project is to create an accessible and easy-to-use tool that can predict the onset of several chronic diseases using machine learning models. By providing a simple web interface, users can input relevant health metrics and receive an instant prediction, raising awareness and demonstrating the practical application of data science in healthcare.

Important Disclaimer: This application is an academic project and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The predictions are based on machine learning models and should be used for informational purposes only.

Key Features
Multi-Disease Prediction: A single, centralized platform for predicting three different health conditions.
Interactive UI: A clean and simple interface created with Streamlit, allowing users to easily input their health parameters.
Real-Time Predictions: Delivers instant predictions from pre-trained machine learning models.
Modular Design: Each disease prediction model operates independently within the Streamlit application.
Models Implemented
This system can predict the following diseases:

Heart Disease
Parkinson's Disease
Diabetes
Technology Stack
